# Glossary

## AI Agent
A software program that uses artificial intelligence to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. In the context of this documentation, it often refers to AI assistants integrated into platforms like GitHub to help with development or curation tasks.

## Claude
A family of large language models (LLMs) developed by Anthropic, known for their capabilities in natural language processing and generation.

## GitHub Actions
An automation platform provided by GitHub that allows users to automate software workflows, including building, testing, and deploying code directly from their repositories.

## Goose
An AI application and host environment that facilitates the configuration and use of Model Context Protocols (MCPs). It supports various AI models and can be used as a desktop or command-line application.

## OBO Format
A standardized file format used for creating and exchanging ontologies, particularly prevalent in the biomedical and life sciences domains. For more details, see the [OBO Flat File Format Specification](http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/GO.format.obo-1_4.html).

## Ontology
A formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization. In practice, it's a structured way of representing knowledge about a specific domain, including concepts, their properties, and the relationships between them.

## PMID (PubMed ID)
A unique numerical identifier assigned to every record in PubMed, the comprehensive database of biomedical literature.

## API Key
A unique code or token that is passed to an Application Programming Interface (API) to authenticate the calling application or user. API keys are used to control access to the API, track usage, and manage permissions.

## Knowledge Base (KB)
A centralized repository for storing and managing complex information, both structured and unstructured. In the context of AI and curation, KBs often refer to curated collections of domain-specific knowledge that AI systems can utilize and help maintain.

## Large Language Model (LLM)
A type of artificial intelligence (AI) model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and process human language. LLMs are the foundation for many modern AI applications, including chatbots and content generation tools.

## LiteLLM
A lightweight library that provides a unified interface for interacting with various Large Language Model (LLM) APIs. It simplifies the process of switching between different LLM providers and managing API calls. For more information, visit [LiteLLM's official documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)
A specification or standard that defines how AI models and external tools or services should communicate and exchange contextual information. MCP enables AI agents to effectively utilize a diverse set of capabilities by providing a common interface for tool interaction.

## ODK (Ontology Development Kit)
A suite of tools, best practices, and standardized workflows for creating, maintaining, and quality control for ontologies, particularly those in the OBO (Open Biomedical Ontologies) ecosystem. More information can be found at the [ODK GitHub repository](https://incatools.github.io/ontology-development-kit/).

## O3 Guidelines
A set of principles and best practices related to ontology and data management. The specifics can vary, but they generally promote interoperability, consistency, and quality in knowledge representation. Users encountering this term are encouraged to search for specific "O3 Guidelines" relevant to the particular project or community context mentioned.

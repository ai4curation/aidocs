### What is AI4Curators?

AI4Curators is a project focused on providing practical guides for curators and maintainers of knowledge bases to integrate AI into their workflows. Rather than theoretical discussions, we emphasize immediate, actionable integration strategies that work with existing GitHub-based workflows.

Our core mission includes:
- Helping curators integrate AI agents into existing GitHub-based workflows
- Providing plugins and tools for existing chat UIs  
- Supporting ontology editing and curation workflows with AI assistance

The project serves both as documentation and a practical example of AI agent integration, where GitHub agents can directly contribute to documentation and examples demonstrate real-world AI-assisted curation workflows.

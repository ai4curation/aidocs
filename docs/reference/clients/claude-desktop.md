Claude Desktop is a local Desktop application
that provides many of the same functionalities as the web app, but allows you to configure your own MCPs.

Claude Desktop is a UI counterpart to [Claude Code](claude-code.md). We include a separate entry for each, because they are quite different in how the interoperate or are configured.

At the time of writing, it is less easy to configure MCPs than it is for Goose.

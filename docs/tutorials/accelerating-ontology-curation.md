# Accelerating Ontology Curation with Agentic AI and GitHub

This tutorial accompanies a workshop at the 16th International Conference on Biological and Biomedical Ontology (ICBO 2025).

## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is having a tremendous impact on science and society. This can be readily observed in fields such as software engineering, where developers are increasingly using AI tools and even ‘vibe coding’ entire projects. However, much of this impact has yet to filter down to curation and ontology development. Many ontology developers report that they are either distrustful of AI, or they don’t know where to start. Additionally, ontology developers may think that parts of their workflow are too complex to use in AI.
In fact, AI is particularly well suited to many complex aspects of ontology development, and if used correctly, can be deployed with high reliability, while giving the human experts full control over tasks. Some ontologies, such as Mondo, Uberon, and the GO, have already successfully incorporated ontology agents into their GitHub-based workflows.
In this tutorial, we will give a practical hands-on guide to ontology developers, showing how to use the latest powerful agent-based AI to support and accelerate their work. At the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to use an AI coding agent as a part of their day-to-day workflow.
